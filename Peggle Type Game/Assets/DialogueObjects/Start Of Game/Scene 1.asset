  sentences:
  - This is where our story begins.
  - Meet Carmen, a desperate, overworked musician who lives solely off the money
    she gets from her live gigs.
  - "You obviously can\u2019t see her because she\u2019s driving, but trust me, she
    is there.\r"
  - "She thinks today is another day where she will frantically drive to a gig\u2026.\r"
  - "But what she doesn\u2019t know is that it won\u2019t play out like that.\r"
  - You see, just straight ahead of her is a wall. That wall will wreck her car.
  - "And as for the rest?\r"
  - "Well, let\u2019s just say this will be the craziest day of Carmen\u2019s life.\r"
  - If it doesn't become the only day.
