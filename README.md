# Pegs of Time
You've got to get to your show. Just one town over and you're at the event space. And then suddenly the wall hits.

Welcome to the town of Silverford! Here, you can meet all of our relatively needy residents, who seem to always have a task they need you to help with. What's that, you're asking how to help them? Well, due to the brain damage from the crash, what is helping in the world will look like a Peggle level. Cool, right? Oh, and more, you seem to keep fainting every 5 minutes, only to find yourself back where you were before. I guess you might want to think about escaping, heh.

Pegs of Time is an incredibly high concept game. You play as Carmen, who is stuck in a time loop. You must help the various residents of the town of Silverford, which you are stuck in, in order to escape the loop. Made over the span of one month as the second project my Computer Science 3 class in high school, I'm very proud of this game. It takes about 15-45 minutes to complete depending on your skill in the levels and your reading speed. Please enjoy!
